# Pneumatics

## Balance changes

The overall purpose of these changes is to encourage the player to explore the new technologies and
build up infrastructure that will eventually be needed for the key attraction (pneumatic armor and
early construction robots).

Since this is a mod that effects early game, that typically means forcing the experienced player to
do things a bit differently by locking some key vanilla technologies behind green or military
science. Otherwise an experienced player might just bypass everything in the mod except for the
early construction bots.

On principle the mod and so should be new player friendly since this is a re-envisioning of the
early game. (Yes, most new players will not be playing with mods.)

### Early game mining

*  Half of the character mining speed bonus from the vanilla Steel Axe technology is redistributed
   to Pneumatics which is available at the very beginning of the game.
